Generate a JSON object `result`, from the log of a running process. You are also given the historical context i.e. the previous logs along with your analysis.

`result.rating` may be none, low, medium, high, or critical based on perceived risk/severity.
`result.actions` is an array of concise steps to mitigate the risks, only if required.
`result.review` is a review of the logs, from the viewpoint of a compliance monitoring service, and log analyzer
`result.citation` gives the line number as integer of the log with issue.

You should only give the RESPONSE in JSON with one single object `result`.
